A - APROG Ratings
Write a program to read the APROG exam scores for a class with N students (for an array). The number of students (N) is entered by the user.
Then calculate and show the class average.
Finally, display how many students failed the course (grade <10).

The program should display the class average (formatted to 1 decimal place) and how many students failed the course on separate lines with the following format:

average=<average>
failures=<number of failures>

B - Minimum
Write a program to read a set of positive integers (for an array). Number reading ends when a negative number is entered.
Then, determine which is the element with minimum value in the set and how many times it has been inserted. The last number (negative) should be avoided.

The program should display the number with minimum value and how many times it was inserted, on separate lines and with the following format:

min=<lowest number>
occurrences=<number of occurrences>
